## How to execute the project

1. Clone the project from GitHub ````https://github.com/felipeam10/QAx````
2. In your preference IDE, open the project from the directory it was cloned to. I sugest that you use VS Code.
3. In your PC needs to node.js version 18.20.4 (stable and recommended version).
4. Install Yarn too (in CMD open how administrator: type "corepack enable". After return to terminal and type "yarn --version"). If return the version, it's worked. 
5. You need too Windows Terminal. Windows Terminal opens with PowerShell by default.
6. Too install Git for Windows + Bash.

## QAx Directories

1. Creating the main folder:

- Create a folder called QAx in the ````C:```` directory with the command: ````mkdir QAx````

2. Creating subfolders:

- Create two subfolders inside QAx:
   - ````mkdir apps```` --> "apps": To store the software targeted for training.
   - ````mkdir projects```` --> "projects": To store automation projects and others.

3. Create a Directory for the Project:
   - In the terminal, create a directory for the project and navigate to it.
   - Example: ````mkdir Cypress-Express-Mark```` && ````cd Cypress-Express-Mark````.

4. Initialize the Node.js Project:
   - Initialize the Node.js project with the ````yarn init```` command.
   - Answer the questions to configure package.json, if applicabe.

5. Install Cypress as a Development Dependency:
   - Install Cypress with the ````yarn add cypress -D command````.

6. Open Cypress:

   - Unzip the file and rename the folder to MarkL (capital L, representing 50 in Roman numerals).


2. Moving Folders:
   - Move the MarkL folder to the ````C:\QAx\Apps```` directory.
   - Delete the .zip file for your organization, if you find it necessary.


3. Accessing the Terminal:
   - Open the terminal and navigate to the MarkL folder using the command ````cd /c/X/Apps/MarkL````.
   - Check the API and web subfolders.


4. Installing API Dependencies:
   - Navigate to the API folder with cd API.
   - Install Node.js dependencies with ````npm install````.
 
  
5. Initializing the Database:
   - Run ````npm run db:init```` to initialize the SQLite database.


6. Running the API:
   - Put the API online with ````npm run dev````.


7. Configuring the Web Application:
   - Open a new terminal window and navigate to the web folder with ````cd /c/QAx/Apps/MarkL/web```` .
   - Install web application dependencies with ````npm install````.
   - Put the web application online with ````npm run dev````.

## Run tests with command line

- For run the regressive tests ````yarn cypress run ````.
- For run in other navigator ````yarn cypress run --browser chrome````.

## Run tests with command line for generate Allure report

- Before, in file cypress-express-mark/package.json add:

```.json
  "@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin": "^2.40.2",
  "allure-commandline": "^2.32.0",
```

- And in file â€Žcypress-express-mark/cypress.config.js add:

```.javascript
const allureWriter = require('@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin/writer');

module.exports = {
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',
    env: {
        apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3333'
    },
    viewportWidth: 1920,
    viewportHeight: 1080,
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      // implement node event listeners here
      allureWriter(on, config);
      return config;
    },
  },
};
```
- For run the regressive tests ````yarn cypress run --env allure=true````.
- For build report ````yarn allure serve````.
